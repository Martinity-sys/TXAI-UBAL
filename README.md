# TXAI-UBAL
Trustworthy and Explainable AI Project - Uncertainty Based Active Learning

For this project we aim to reproce <em>[The power of ensembles for active learning in image classification (Beluch et al.)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8579074)</em>. we trained 7 different models for uncertainty based active learning. We train Monte Carlo Dropout with variation ratio and variance, Monte Carlo Dropconnect with variation ratio and variance, ensembles with variation ratio and variance, and a random acquisition model.
